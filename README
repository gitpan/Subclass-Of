NAME
    Subclass::Of - import a magic subclass

SYNOPSIS
    Create a subclass overriding a method:

            use Subclass::Of "LWP::UserAgent",
                    -as      => "ImpatientUA",
                    -methods => [
                            sub new {
                                    my $self = ::SUPER();
                                    $self->timeout(15);
                                    $self->max_redirect(3);
                                    return $self;
                            }
                    ];
        
            my $ua = ImpatientUA->new;

    Create a subclass, adding roles:

            use Subclass::Of "Some::Class",
                    -with => [qw/ My::Role Your::Role Another::Role /];
        
            my $thing = Class->new;

DESCRIPTION
    Load a class, creating a subclass of it with additional roles (Moose,
    Mouse, Moo and Role::Tiny should all work) and/or additional methods.
